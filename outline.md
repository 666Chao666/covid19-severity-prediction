**Goal:** prioritizing where ventilators go

**Data:** 

- hospital-level: information about hospitals (e.g. number of icu beds, hospital type, location)
- county-level: confirmed cases + deaths, demographics, comorbidity statistics, voting data, local gov. action data

**Approach:** 

- predict outbreak risk at county-level based on these features
- filter hospitals and rank them according to their outbreak risk + ventilator need
