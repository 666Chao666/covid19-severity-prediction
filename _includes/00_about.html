<a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~yugroup/people.html">Our group</a> at UC Berkeley is working to help forecast the severity of the epidemic both for individual counties and individual hospitals. As a byproduct, we have and will continue to produce models, visualizations, and curated datasets (including confirmed cases/deaths, demographics, risk factors, social distancing data) that can be used by other teams in the fight against COVID-19. We are collaborating with <a href="https://response4life.org/">Response4Life</a>, a non-profit organization, whose goal is to blunt the effect of COVID-19 through the production and appropriate distribution of PPE, medical equipment, and medical personnel to healthcare facilities across the United States.
