- county-level: daily confirmed cases + deaths, demographics, comorbidity statistics, voting data, local gov. action data, population density, risk factors from medicare (e.g. diabetes, respiratory disease, other chronic conditions)
- hospital-level: information about hospitals (e.g. number of icu beds, hospital type, location)    
- limitations
    - currently using proxies for hospitals supplies/demands instead of real measurements
    - limited data on bridging county-level data with hospital-level data
    - missing some local data which would be helpful, such as amount of testing and social distancing measures
