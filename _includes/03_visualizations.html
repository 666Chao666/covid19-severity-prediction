<h3 align="center"> County-level </h3>

Many of the county-level features we have collected are correlated with the total number of deaths recorded so far at each county (and with each other):

## Interactive visualizations of different counties

We can also plot the predicted number of deaths at the county-level:

This covid pandemic severity index is designed to help decide where medical resources should be allocated. It takes on three values (3: High, 2: Medium, 1: Low), indicating the severity of the covid-19 outbreak for a given hospital on a certain day. It is calculated in three steps:

- county-level predictions for number of deaths are modeled
- county-level predictions are allocated to hospitals within counties proportional the their total number of employees
- final value is decided by thresholding the number of cumulative predicted deaths for a hospital (=current recorded deaths + predicted future deaths)
