<p> This <strong>covid pandemic severity index (CPSI)</strong> is designed to help aid the distribution of medical resources to hospitals.
  It takes on three values (3: High, 2: Medium, 1: Low), indicating the severity of the covid-19 outbreak for a hospital on a certain day. It is calculated in three steps:

  (1) county-level predictions for number of deaths are modeled
(2) county-level predictions are allocated to hospitals within counties proportional the their total number of employees
(3) final value is decided by thresholding the number of cumulative predicted deaths for a hospital (=current recorded deaths + predicted future deaths).

  The map below shows hospitals along with their severity indexes and some additional data.
  See  evolution of the CPSI for different hospitals as a function of the total deaths recorded at that hospital so far, and the predicted deaths <a href="https://yu-group.github.io/covid19-severity-prediction/results/hospital_index_animated.html"> here. </a>
