## Overview of all the data sets

**Overview below, detailed documentation in the [list of columns](list_of_columns.md)

The Yu group at UC Berkeley Statistics and EECS has compiled, cleaned and documented
a large corpus of hospital- and county-level data from a variety of public sources to
aid data science efforts to combat COVID-19. At the hospital level, our data
include the location of the hospital, the number of ICU beds, the total number
of employees, and the hospital type. At the county level, our data include
COVID-19 cases/deaths from USA Facts and NYT, automatically updated every day,
along with demographic information, health resource availability, COVID-19
health risk factors, and social mobility information. An overview of each data
set in this corpus is provided in this file.

An overview of each data set in this corpus is provided below. The data is also available on the AWS Data Exchange [here](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-px2tvvydirx4o?qid=1587582026402&sr=0-1&ref_=srh_res_product_title#overview).

## Quickstart
To load the county-level data (daily COVID-19 cases/deaths data + other county-level features listed above) from the project root directory:
```python
import data
# unabridged
df_unabridged = data.load_county_data(data_dir = "data", cached = False, abridged = False)
# abridged
df_abrdiged = data.load_county_data(data_dir = "data", cached = False, abridged = True)
```


## Folder Structure 
In this folder, we collect the useful hospital level data from a variety of sources. The structure of the folder is as the following:
- raw (contains raw data)
    - [datasource]_[shortname]/
        - load.py (a script that loads the data)
        - download.py (a script that downloads the data)
        - raw data
        - Readme.md (metadata for the raw data)
- processed (contains the processed data)
    - [datasource]_[shortname]/
        - clean.py (a script that cleans the data)
        - cleaned data
        - Readme.md (metadata for the cleaned data)


We prepared this data to support emergency medical supply distribution efforts
through short-term (days) prediction of COVID-19 deaths (and cases) at the
county level. We are using the predictions and hospital data to arrive at a
covid Pandemic Severity Index (c-PSI) for each hospital. This project is in
partnership with [response4life.org](http://response4life.org). We will be
adding more relevant data sets as they are found.
