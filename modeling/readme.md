# modeling docs

The model training and visualization pipeline lives in: `modeling/basic_model_framework.ipynb`
which will train and visualize the outputs of various models.

The high level wrapper for training and predicting values is the fit_and_predict function in `modeling/fit_and_predict.py`
this allows you to train a few models by passing in different arguments. For more details please see the function documentation.
